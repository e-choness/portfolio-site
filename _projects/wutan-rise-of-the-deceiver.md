**Core Premise:** Players join forces with the legendary Wu-Tang Clan to combat the invading forces of the Deceiver and restore balance to Shaolin.

### Project Highlights & My Contributions

**1. Online Multiplayer System Architecture & Development**

- **Role:** Lead Developer, Online Systems
- **Description:** Designed, implemented, and optimized the robust online multiplayer framework enabling seamless 3-player cooperative gameplay. This involved architecting the client-server communication, managing session states, and ensuring low-latency interactions crucial for a real-time action RPG.
- **Technologies Utilized:**
  - **Unreal Engine:** Integrated multiplayer functionalities within the engine's networking framework.
  - **Azure:** Leveraged Azure services for scalable backend infrastructure, including matchmaking, persistent data storage, and potentially dedicated server hosting.
  - **C++:** Developed core networking logic, replication systems, and game state synchronization.
  - **Node.js:** Implemented backend services for real-time communication, user authentication, and social features, providing a flexible and high-performance server-side environment.

**2. Live Operations (LiveOps) Management**

- **Role:** LiveOps Engineer
- **Description:** Established and maintained systems for monitoring game performance, identifying and resolving real-time issues, and ensuring continuous service availability. This included proactive error detection, patch deployment strategies, and managing live game environments to provide a stable and engaging player experience.
- **Key Responsibilities:** Incident response, performance monitoring, deployment pipeline management, and data analysis for live service improvements.

3. **Game Tools Development**

- **Role:** Tools Engineer
- **Description:** Developed essential in-house tools to streamline various aspects of game development, content creation, and live service management. These tools significantly improved iteration speed, reduced manual effort, and enhanced team productivity.
- **Technologies Utilized:**
  - **C# / .NET Framework:** Created intuitive and powerful desktop applications and utilities for designers, artists, and other developers, ranging from data editors to asset management tools and build automation scripts.

### Game Features & My Impact

- **3-Player Co-op:** My work on the online multiplayer system was foundational to this core feature, allowing players to unite against the Deceiver.
- **Dynamic Difficulty (Chambers):** The online system supported the progressive difficulty scaling as players delve deeper into the "Chambers" of the dreamworld.
- **Player Customization:** While not directly involved in the art or design of customization, my backend and tools work indirectly supported the integration and management of player customization for fighters, fighting styles, and "iconic fits" using "Jewels."
- **Social Hub (Shaolin):** The online infrastructure provides the backbone for the social hub in Shaolin, facilitating player interactions and community engagement.
