about:
  description: |
    I'm a passionate full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience creating digital solutions that make a difference. 
    My journey in technology began with curiosity and has evolved into a love for crafting elegant, efficient code that solves real-world problems.

    I specialize in modern web technologies and have a strong background in both frontend and backend development. 
    When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community.
